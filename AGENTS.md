# git-ticket

A Git-native work ledger: Markdown tickets in `.tickets/`, one Go library, a
`git ticket` CLI. Read `docs/plan.md` before you change anything. It is the
design of record, not background reading.

## State

Phase 0 and Phase 1 are done and their exit criteria hold. The library parses,
renders, validates, queries, and mutates, with the store lock and the revision
precondition. Phase 2, the standalone CLI in section 12.1, is next and no Go
exists for it yet: there is no `cmd/git-ticket`.

Section 13 of the plan lists the phases and their exit criteria. Do not start a
later phase before an earlier one meets its criteria.

The repository is local only, on `main`, with no remote.

## Commands

```sh
go test ./...
```

That is the whole suite, including the tests that hold the corpus to the plan.
Run it after touching anything under `testdata/` or section 11 of the plan.

## Layout

`docs/plan.md` is the format, the store, the CLI, and every decision behind
them. Sections 4 through 11 are the format itself.

`testdata/` is the fixture corpus. Read `testdata/README.md` before adding to
it.

`ticket/` is the library. `ticket/corpus_test.go` holds the corpus to its own
rules: every fixture pairs with a sidecar, every code in section 11 has a
fixture, and no sidecar names a code the plan does not define. It replaced
`scripts/check-corpus.py`, which did the same job from outside until there was a
real parser to do it from inside.

## The plan is authoritative

Do not settle a format question in code. If the code needs the format to
change, change `docs/plan.md` in the same commit and say why in the message.

When the plan does not answer a question, add it to section 15 instead of
inventing an answer. The two that blocked Phase 1 are settled: a `blocked`
reason lives in `status_reason` and in `Notes`, per 5.1 and 6.2, and a
`references` path resolves against the Git repository root, per 5.5. The end of
section 15 records both.

## Conventions

Names are singular: `git ticket`, the `ticket_*` tools, the `ticket` package.
Directories stay plural: `.tickets/`, `tickets/`, `archive/`.

Fixtures are static files a person reviewed. Never generate one at test time.
Every fixture carries an `.expected.json` sidecar even when it is clean,
because a missing expectation cannot be told apart from a forgotten one.

Time-dependent behaviour uses the fixed reference instant
`2026-09-30T00:00:00Z`. Inject it. Never read the system clock in a test.

## Policy

This repository owns the format, the store, validation, and the CLI. Nothing
here imports terva. The terva integration is Phase 3 and is tracked in terva's
own `docs/plans/git-ticket.md`.

The library reaches no network and runs no Git command that writes. No fetch,
push, merge, commit, or branch switch. Publishing is the user's ordinary Git
workflow, and a helper that does it for them is out of scope for v1.

## Gotchas

`go:embed` silently skips any path whose name starts with `.` or `_`. That is
why store fixtures live under `store/` and not `.tickets/`. The realistic name
would embed nothing and leave a suite of tests passing against an empty corpus.

Renaming a code in section 11 fails `TestCorpusCoversEveryPlanCode` until the
sidecars follow. That is intended. The corpus and the spec are one artifact.

Adding a frontmatter field means editing every fixture that carries one, because
5.3 renders an absent scalar as `null` rather than omitting it. The round-trip
test fails on all 32 of them until they agree with the renderer. `status_reason`
cost exactly that.
